## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This theme is inspired by Claude's clean and professional interface. The goal was to create a workspace that feels:

- **Warm and inviting** - Not sterile or cold
- **Professional** - Suitable for serious work
- **Readable** - Optimized for long reading sessions
- **Unobtrusive** - The content is the focus, not the theme

## 🛠️ Customization

You can customize the theme by editing the CSS variables at the top of `theme.css`:

```css
body.theme-dark {
  --background-primary: #262624;
  --interactive-accent: #D97757;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```
